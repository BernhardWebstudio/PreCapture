<h1>Purpose the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is designed to create human and machine readable labels to 
accompany containers of collection objects (Folders of Herbarium Sheets, 
Unit Trays of Insects, etc.) into a digitization apparatus where the machine
readable information can be extracted at the container level and applied to the
digital records of each of the contained collection objects.</p>

<h1>Using the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>The pre-capture application has three main functions: First, to capture the
information that applies to all specimens within a container.  Second, to print out
sets of labels (on paper or adhesive label stock) that can be associated with 
containers such as folders or unit trays.  Third, to take a rough inventory of the
number of specimens for which pre-capture labels are being generated.  These three 
functions are reflected on the three main tabs of the application ()</p>

<h1>Configuring the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is highly configurable.  Some of the configuration is accessed
through the configuration dialog in the user interface, other elements are in a 
properties file, others in xml configuration files.</p>
<h2>Loading a Taxon Authority File</h2>
<p>Construct a csv file with the following columns:</p>
<pre>
Family,Genus,SpecificEpithet,SubspecificEpithet,InfraspecificEpithet,InfraspecificRank,Authorship
</pre>
<p>Load this file from the <strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog 
(accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>), by pressing the <strong>Load Taxon Authority File</strong> 
button and picking a csv file.  The new authority list will be available in the Taxon combo box when
you delete all text from the box.</p>

<h2>Editing properties</h2>
<p>Properties are store in a text file called PreCapture.properties which is created in the
application directory.  You can edit this file directly, or with the Properties tab of the Configuration Dialog.</p>
<p>To change the main frame from separate tabs for Label and Print List to a split pane, 
change the property config.mainuiframe from "MainFrame" to "MainFrameAlternative"</p>

<h1>Managing backups</h1>
<p>The Inventory data set and the loaded taxon authority file are backed up to
.csv exports each time the program successfully exits.</p>
<p>Backups of the taxon authority file and inventory can be reloaded from the 
<strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog (accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>).
