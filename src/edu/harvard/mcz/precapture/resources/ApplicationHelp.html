<h1>Purpose of the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is designed to create human and machine readable labels to 
accompany containers of collection objects (Folders of Herbarium Sheets, 
Unit Trays of Insects, etc.) into a digitization apparatus where the machine
readable information can be extracted at the container level and applied to the
digital records of each of the contained collection objects.  The purpose of
this is to reduce redundant capture of information.  For example, all 
the herbarium sheets in a folder are likely to share a current filed under
identification.  An initial pre-data-capture pass through the collection can 
capture this current identification once, print it in machine readable form, and 
associate that printed information with the folder.  Thus, when that folder is 
brought to a station in a workflow, the machine readable information can be 
scanned and associated with the image and database record of each specimen 
in the folder, without the current identification having to be retyped for each 
sheet.  This concept of capturing information from the storage of collection 
objects prior to data capture and then applying the information to all collection 
objects from within a given container can be applied within any discipline 
where multiple collection objects sharing similar information are stored
in the same container.</p>

<h1>Using the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>The pre-capture application has three main functions: First, to capture the
information that applies to all specimens within a container.  Second, to print out
sets of labels or pages (on paper or adhesive label stock) that can be associated with 
containers such as folders or unit trays.  Third, to take a rough inventory of the
number of specimens for which pre-capture labels are being generated.  These three 
functions are reflected on the three main tabs of the application.</p>

<img src="ScreenshotMainWindow.png">

<p>An alternative view places the form to capture the fields pertaining to a container 
next to the spreadsheet list of the set of labels to be printed.</p>

<img src="ScreenshotSplitScreenMainWindow.png">

<h3>Basic Workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select a taxon name from the picklist.   The atomic taxon name fields are filled in.</li>
<li>Add additional information that applies to all sheets in the folder/container</li>
<li>If more than one folder/container contains the same information, increase the number of labels to print.</li>
<li>Press Add To List.</li>
<li>When you are ready to print several different labels, go to the Folders tab.</li>
<li>Adjust any information you wish to change</li>
<li>Press Print (The labels will be written to a PDF file named labels.pdf, and a printer dialog will be invoked.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The organization of folders of herbarium sheets in cabinets (and other sorts of collection objects in other collections) often
follows a taxonomic heirarchy.  The taxon pick list can be filtered to reflect this organization.  If you are working with 
a cabinet of herbarium sheets that contains a single family, you can select the family name on the Filter by Family picklist</p>

<img src="ScreenShotPickAFamily.png">

<p>Once you have selected a family, you can tab into the taxon name picklist and begin to enter any part of the taxon name 
that is the filed under name for a folder.  The taxon name picklist will open showing the taxa within the family, and as you type
will filter that list down to names that contain the part of the name that you are typing.</p>

<img src="ScreenShotFilterTaxa.png"> 

<p>The arrow keys will move you down into the taxon pick list, and tab will pick the current selection (or you can click on
a name in the list).  Once you have selected a name from the taxon pick list, the fields for that taxon name will be 
automatically filled in, and you can tab (or use alt and a number key to move directly to a field in the list Alt-9 goes to
the 9th item in the list (you can use these key combinations instead of tab to leave the taxon picklist)) to other 
fields that you want to populate with information that applies to all sheets within  the folder.  The list of fields is 
configurable for a project and the number and specific fields present on the form may be different from the screenshots.
If you have more than one folder with identical information, you can set the number to print field to the number of copies
of the label for that folder that you want to print.</p>

<img src="ScreenshotTaxonPicked.png">

<p>Once you have filled in all the fields that apply to all sheets in the folder that you are working on, you can press Print to 
print the single label that you have just filled in (in the number of copies specified with by number to print field), at which 
point a printer dialog will pop up and a pdf file named <em>labels.pdf</em> will be written to the current folder.  The pdf file
will be written even if you hit cancel on the printer dialog.</p>

<img src="screenshot_print_dialog.png">

<p>The resulting label will print in the currently selected print format (see Print format configuration below).</p>

<img src="ExampleLabel_Malaxis_monophyllos.png">

<p>Alternatively, you can press the Add to Print List button (Alt-A), and add the current label to the list on the Print List tab, 
where you can modify the information and print larger sets of labels as desired.  As with printing a single label, printing a 
set of labels will bring up the printer dialog and write the labels to <em>labels.pdf</em></p>

<img src="ScreenshotPrintListTab.png">

<p>If you switch to the split screen view <strong>Window/Change to...</strong>, the field list will appear on the left side of 
the screen, and the print list on the right, all in the same tab.  You can switch back and forth between views while retaining 
the same print list.  The print list does not persist between restarts of the program.  It is cleared when you exit or when you
press the <strong>Clear</strong> button.</p>

<h3>Inventory</h3>

<p>If the inventory functionality has been enabled in your installation (property config.showinventorytab=true), then a tab 
will show up in the main program screen labeled <strong>Inventory</strong>.  This tab allows you to estimate the number of 
specimens that are to be imaged within a container.  The default configuration is for herbarium cabinets, organized by 
family, with measurements of how many inches thickness of sheets are present for the folders covered by your project in
this cabinet in this family, along with an estimate of how many sheets are found per inch in this family.  Follow project
protocols for how to use this inventory if your project includes an inventory estimation in the precapture phase.  
</p>

<h3>Editing the Taxon Authority File</h3>

<p>This functionality is not yet available inside the PreCapture application, see Loading a Taxon Authority File</p>

<h3>Exiting the application</h3>

<p>To exit, use <strong>File/Exit</strong>from the main menu.  During a normal exit, backups of the taxon authority file 
and inventory are made.  See: managing backups.</p>

<h1>Configuring the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is highly configurable.  Some of the configuration is accessed
through the configuration dialog in the user interface, other elements are in a 
properties file, others in xml configuration files.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration can be changed in the following places.  User marks configurations that are expected
to be set by individual users.  Administrator marks configurations that are expected to be set at
particular deployment sites or for particular projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a configured print format (through the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User</strong></li>
<li>Loading a new Taxon Authority file (through the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User</strong></li>
<li>Properties (in properties file, editable from the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User & Administrator</strong></li>
<li>Changing available print formats through an XML Configuration file). <strong>Administrator</strong></li>
<li>Changing the list of fields for the container labels (through an XML Configuration file).  <strong>Administrator</strong></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Selecting a configured Print Format</h2>

<p>Open the configuration dialog with <em>File/Configuration</em>.  Select the <strong>Printing</strong> tab.
From the picklist select the desired configured print format to use.  If you need a different format that isn't
listed on this screen, see the Editing XML formats section below.  You can set the default print format
from the Properties tab, by setting the value of the <em>config.selectedprintdefinition</em> property to match the
desired default format name.</p>

<img src="PrintFormatDialog.png">

<h2>Loading a Taxon Authority File</h2>
<p>Construct a csv file with the following columns:</p>
<pre>
Family,Genus,SpecificEpithet,SubspecificEpithet,InfraspecificEpithet,InfraspecificRank,Authorship
</pre>
<p>This file must be comma separated, the text fields may optionally be enclosed in quotes.  Encoding must be utf-8.</p>
<p>Load this file from the <strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog 
(accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>), by pressing the <strong>Load Taxon Authority File</strong> 
button and picking a csv file.  The new authority list will be available in the Taxon combo box when
you delete all text from the box.</p>

<h2>Editing properties</h2>
<p>Properties are store in a text file called PreCapture.properties which is created in the
application directory.  You can edit this file directly, or with the Properties tab of the Configuration Dialog.</p>
<p>To change the main frame from separate tabs for Label and Print List to a split pane, 
change the property config.mainuiframe from "MainFrame" to "MainFrameAlternative"</p>
<img src="ScreenshotConfigurationDialogProperties.png">

<h3>Properties that users may wish to set</h3>

<ul>
<li>config.selectedprintdefinition The print definition to use by default from the print format definition file.</li>
<li>config.mainuiframe The variant of the user interface to use.  MainFrame is the default with folder details and the print list in separate tabs, MainFrameAlternative includes the folder details and print lists in a split pane within a single tab.</li>
<li>config.mycollectioncode  The collection code/Herbarium Acronym for the collection. The default value to use for a field that is mapped to the concept dwc:collectionCode.</li>
<li>config.filterlengththreshold The number of characters to type into the taxon picker box before it starts filtering.  3 is probably a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All Available properties</h3>

<ul>
<li>print.papersize Not currently in use.</li>
<li>config.fieldmap The location of the XML configuration file for fields to print on container labels.  A relative path is inside the jar, an absolute path on the local filesystem.</li>
<li>config.editableauthorityfile Not currently in use.</li>
<li>config.showinventorytab true to include the Inventory tab in the application, false to hide it.</li>
<li>config.printdefinitions The location of the XML configuration file for print format definitions.  A relative path is inside the jar, an absolute path on the local filesystem.</li>
<li>config.selectedprintdefinition The print definition to use by default from the print format definition file.</li>
<li>config.mainuiframe The variant of the user interface to use.  MainFrame is the default with folder details and the print list in separate tabs, MainFrameAlternative includes the folder details and print lists in a split pane within a single tab.</li>
<li>config.mycollectioncode  The collection code/Herbarium Acronym for the collection. The default value to use for a field that is mapped to the concept dwc:collectionCode.</li>
<li>config.filterlengththreshold The number of characters to type into the taxon picker box before it starts filtering.  3 is probably a good choice.</li>
<li>config.qr_errorcorrection The QRCode redundancy level to use.  One of L, M, Q, H.  H is recommended.  L allows about a 7% loss, H about a 30% loss.  H makes for more reliable reading, but more bits in the barcode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editing XML Configurations</h2>

<p>Print formats and fields on container labels are controled by XML configuration files.  These XML configuration files
follow XML schema documents present in the repository.   </p>
<ul>
<li>http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/supporting/LabelDefinitionSchema.xsd</li>
<li>http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/supporting/PreCaptureFieldSchema.xsd</li>
</ul> 

<p>Default configurations for print format and field list are included in the packaged jar file.  
Additional configurations can be created and either package in the jar file or placed on the local 
file system.  The PreCapture.properties file contains a property for the location of each of these
two configuration files.  A relative path will be within the jar, and absolute path on the local 
file system.</p>

<h3>Editing the Print Format configuration</h3>

<p>Obtain a copy of the default print format configuration file: http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/src/edu/harvard/mcz/precapture/resources/LabelDefinitions.xml</p>
<p>Save this file to your local file system and edit as desired (e.g. by adding new configurations).  See the schema for documentation of each element.</p>
<p>Edit the property config.printdefinitions in PreCapture.properties to point to the absolute path to your new file on your file system.</p>
<p>Test barcode generation using the longest text strings that you expect to generate, and see if the barcodes that are produced are consistently readable from
the printer(s) that you are using</p> 

<h3>Editing the field list configuration</h3>

<p>Obtain a copy of the default field list configuration file: http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/src/edu/harvard/mcz/precapture/resources/NEVP_TCN_PrecaptureFields.xml</p>
<p>Save this file to your local file system and edit as desired.  See the schema for documentation of each element.   <strong>You must set a new version number
in this file if you make any changes.</strong></p>
<p>Edit the property config.fieldmap in PreCapture.properties to point to the absolute path to your new file on your file system.</p>
<p><strong>You Must make a copy of this file available to the software running the digitization apparatus to allow the encoded information to be 
correctly decoded when the barcodes are read during digitization.</strong>  The project and version of the configuration file are encoded in the
barcode and will be used to match the rest of the barcode to the correct configuration file and the correct decoding of the barcodes into fields.</p> 

<h1>Managing backups</h1>
<p>The Inventory data set and the loaded taxon authority file are backed up to
.csv exports each time the program successfully exits.  These files are placed in a folder called <em>backups</em> inside
the current directory.  A new timestamped backup of the inventory file is written each time the program
exits, and the inventory and taxon authority file are also both backed up to files named Inventory_backup.csv and 
TaxonAuthorityFile_backup.csv, overwriting the existing file each time the program exits.</p>
<p>Backups of the taxon authority file and inventory can be reloaded from the 
<strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog (accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>).
