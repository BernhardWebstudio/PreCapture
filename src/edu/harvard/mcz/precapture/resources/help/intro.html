<h1>Purpose of the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is designed to create human and machine readable labels to
    accompany containers of collection objects (Folders of Herbarium Sheets,
    Unit Trays of Insects, etc.) into a digitization apparatus where the machine
    readable information can be extracted at the container level and applied to the
    digital records of each of the contained collection objects. The purpose of
    this is to reduce redundant capture of information. For example, all
    the herbarium sheets in a folder are likely to share a current filed under
    identification. An initial pre-data-capture pass through the collection can
    capture this current identification once, print it in machine readable form, and
    associate that printed information with the folder. Thus, when that folder is
    brought to a station in a workflow, the machine readable information can be
    scanned and associated with the image and database record of each specimen
    in the folder, without the current identification having to be retyped for each
    sheet. This concept of capturing information from the storage of collection
    objects prior to data capture and then applying the information to all collection
    objects from within a given container can be applied within any discipline
    where multiple collection objects sharing similar information are stored
    in the same container.</p>
