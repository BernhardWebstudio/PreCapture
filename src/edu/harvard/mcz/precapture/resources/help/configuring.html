<h1>Configuring the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is highly configurable.  Some of the configuration is accessed
through the configuration dialog in the user interface, other elements are in a 
properties file, others in xml configuration files.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration can be changed in the following places.  User marks configurations that are expected
to be set by individual users.  Administrator marks configurations that are expected to be set at
particular deployment sites or for particular projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a configured print format (through the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User</strong></li>
<li>Loading a new Taxon Authority file (through the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User</strong></li>
<li>Properties (in properties file, editable from the Configuration Dialog) <strong>User &amp; Administrator</strong></li>
<li>Changing available print formats through an XML Configuration file). <strong>Administrator</strong></li>
<li>Changing the list of fields for the container labels (through an XML Configuration file).  <strong>Administrator</strong></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Selecting a configured Print Format</h2>

<p>Open the configuration dialog with <em>File/Configuration</em>.  Select the <strong>Printing</strong> tab.
From the picklist select the desired configured print format to use.  If you need a different format that isn't
listed on this screen, see the Editing XML formats section below.  You can set the default print format
from the Properties tab, by setting the value of the <em>config.selectedprintdefinition</em> property to match the
desired default format name.</p>

<h2>Loading a Taxon Authority File</h2>
<p>Construct a csv file with the following columns:</p>
<pre>
Family,Genus,SpecificEpithet,SubspecificEpithet,InfraspecificEpithet,InfraspecificRank,Authorship
</pre>
<p>This file must be comma separated, the text fields may optionally be enclosed in quotes.  Encoding must be utf-8.</p>
<p>Load this file from the <strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog 
(accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>), by pressing the <strong>Load Taxon Authority File</strong> 
button and picking a csv file.  The new authority list will be available in the Taxon combo box when
you delete all text from the box.</p>

<h2>Editing properties</h2>
<p>Properties are store in a text file called PreCapture.properties which is created in the
application directory.  You can edit this file directly, or with the Properties tab of the Configuration Dialog.</p>
<p>To change the main frame from separate tabs for Label and Print List to a split pane, 
change the property config.mainuiframe from "MainFrame" to "MainFrameAlternative"</p>

<h3>Properties that users may wish to set</h3>

<ul>
<li>config.selectedprintdefinition The print definition to use by default from the print format definition file.</li>
<li>config.mainuiframe The variant of the user interface to use.  MainFrame is the default with folder details and the print list in separate tabs, MainFrameAlternative includes the folder details and print lists in a split pane within a single tab.</li>
<li>config.mycollectioncode  The collection code/Herbarium Acronym for the collection. The default value to use for a field that is mapped to the concept dwc:collectionCode.</li>
<li>config.filterlengththreshold The number of characters to type into the taxon picker box before it starts filtering.  3 is probably a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Properties related to the handling of below species rank names</h3>
<p>These properties control how trinomials and quadrinomials are transfered from the taxon authority file onto the print list.  
There are three options (1) allowquadrinomials=true, both subspecific epithet and infraspecific epithet are copied over if present.  
(2) allowquadrinomials=false, putsubspeciesininfra=true always construct a trinomial with the trivial epithet being placed in the infraspecificEpithet field.  If a subspecies epithet is being placed in infraspecificName, place the value from config.trinomialsubsprank in infraspecificRank.   
(3)  allowquadrinomials=false, putsubspeciesininfra=false if subspecific epithet is populated but infraspecific epithet is not, copy the subspecific epithet to subspecific epithet and leave infraspecific epithet blank, otherwise for a quadrinomial, leave subspecific epithet blank and put the trivial epithet into infraspecificepithet with a corresponding infraspecific rank.</p>
<li>config.usequadranomials true to allow both the subspecificEpithet and the infraspecificEpithet to be populated when copying data from the taxon authority file to the print list, false leaves out the subspecific epithet for a quadrinomial converting it to a trinomial with the placement of the trivial epithet governed by config.putsubspeciesininfra.
<li>config.putsubspeciesininfra (=true), if true, and usequadrinomials=false, then when copying names from the taxon authority file into the print list, places subspecies in infraspecificRank, with a rank of config.trinomialsubsprank.</li>
<li>config.trinomialsubsprank (=subspecies) the value is used for infraspecific rank when a subspecies is placed in infraspecificEpithet, and used to identify an infraspecific name that is of rank subspecies.</li>

<h3>All Available properties</h3>

<ul>
<li>print.outputfile (=labels.pdf) The pdf file to which labels are written to before being sent to the printer.</li>
<li>config.fieldmap The location of the XML configuration file for fields to print on container labels.  
A relative path is inside the jar, an absolute path on the local filesystem.  
Configurations included in the jar are: </li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>resources/MCZ_Lepidoptera_PrecaptureFields.xml (supported by DataShot)</li>
<li>resources/ETHZ_PrecaptureFields.xml (Supported by DataShot > v1.1.0)</li>
<li>resources/NEVP_TCN_PrecaptureFields.xml (Supported by the NEVP high throughput application)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>config.displayauthorityfile true to display the authority file in a separate tab.</li>
<li>config.editableauthorityfile true to display the authority file in editable form in a separate tab, also may allow copying of fields from the authority file to the print list.</li>
<li>config.extrahumantext Additional human readable text that is added to the label (e.g. "Do not remove from folder")</li>
<li>config.showinventorytab true to include the Inventory tab in the application, false to hide it.</li>
<li>config.printdefinitions The location of the XML configuration file for print format definitions.  A relative path is inside the jar, an absolute path on the local filesystem.</li>
<li>config.selectedprintdefinition The print definition to use by default from the print format definition file.</li>
<li>config.mainuiframe The variant of the user interface to use.  <strong>MainFrame</strong> is the default with folder details
 and the print list in separate tabs, <strong>MainFrameAlternative</strong> includes the folder details and 
 print lists in a split pane within a single tab.</li>
<li>config.mycollectioncode  The collection code/Herbarium Acronym for the collection. The default value to use for a field that is mapped to the concept dwc:collectionCode.</li>
<li>config.filterlengththreshold (=4) The number of characters to type into the taxon picker box before it starts filtering.  3 is probably a good choice.</li>
<li>config.qr_errorcorrection The QRCode redundancy level to use.  One of L, M, Q, H.  H is recommended. 
 L allows about a 7% loss, H about a 30% loss.  H makes for more reliable reading, but more bits in the barcode.</li>
<li>config.usequadranomials true to allow both the subspecificEpithet and the infraspecificEpithet to be populated when copying data from the taxon authority file to the print list, false leaves out the subspecific epithet for a quadrinomial converting it to a trinomial with the placement of the trivial epithet governed by config.putsubspeciesininfra.</li>
<li>config.trinomialsubsprank=subspecies the value is used for infraspecific rank when a subspecies is placed in infraspecificEpithet.</li>
<li>config.putsubspeciesininfra (=true), if true, and usequadrinomials=false, then when copying names from the taxon authority file into the print list, places subspecies in infraspecificRank, with a rank of config.trinomialsubsprank.</li>
<li>debug.labellayout (=false), if true, prints labels with layout lines for debuging label layout designs</li>
<li>print.papersize Not currently in use.</li>
<li>config.ediableunittraylabeldb Not currently in use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editing XML Configurations</h2>

<p>Print formats and fields on container labels are controled by XML configuration files.  These XML configuration files
follow XML schema documents present in the repository.   </p>
<ul>
<li>http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/supporting/LabelDefinitionSchema.xsd</li>
<li>http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/supporting/PreCaptureFieldSchema.xsd</li>
</ul> 

<p>Default configurations for print format and field list are included in the packaged jar file.  
Additional configurations can be created and either package in the jar file or placed on the local 
file system.  The PreCapture.properties file contains a property for the location of each of these
two configuration files.  A relative path will be within the jar, and absolute path on the local 
file system.</p>

<h3>Editing the Print Format configuration</h3>

<p>Obtain a copy of the default print format configuration file: http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/src/edu/harvard/mcz/precapture/resources/LabelDefinitions.xml</p>
<p>Save this file to your local file system and edit as desired (e.g. by adding new configurations).  See the schema for documentation of each element.</p>
<p>Edit the property config.printdefinitions in PreCapture.properties to point to the absolute path to your new file on your file system.</p>
<p>Test barcode generation using the longest text strings that you expect to generate, and see if the barcodes that are produced are consistently readable from
the printer(s) that you are using</p> 

<h3>Editing the field list configuration</h3>

<p>Obtain a copy of the default field list configuration file: http://datashot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/datashot/trunk/precapture_app/src/edu/harvard/mcz/precapture/resources/NEVP_TCN_PrecaptureFields.xml</p>
<p>Save this file to your local file system and edit as desired.  See the schema for documentation of each element.   <strong>You must set a new version number
in this file if you make any changes.</strong></p>
<p>Edit the property config.fieldmap in PreCapture.properties to point to the absolute path to your new file on your file system.</p>
<p><strong>You Must make a copy of this file available to the software running the digitization apparatus to allow the encoded information to be 
correctly decoded when the barcodes are read during digitization.</strong>  The project and version of the configuration file are encoded in the
barcode and will be used to match the rest of the barcode to the correct configuration file and the correct decoding of the barcodes into fields.</p> 

<h1>Managing backups</h1>
<p>The Inventory data set and the loaded taxon authority file are backed up to
.csv exports each time the program successfully exits.  These files are placed in a folder called <em>backups</em> inside
the current directory.  A new timestamped backup of the inventory file is written each time the program
exits, and the inventory and taxon authority file are also both backed up to files named Inventory_backup.csv and 
TaxonAuthorityFile_backup.csv, overwriting the existing file each time the program exits.</p>
<p>Backups of the taxon authority file and inventory can be reloaded from the 
<strong>Data Sources</strong> tab of the Configuration Dialog (accessed with <em>File/Configuration</em>).
